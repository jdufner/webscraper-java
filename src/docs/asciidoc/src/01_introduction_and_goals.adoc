== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

Today, the internet provides tons of new information per day.
To keep pace, I want to get summaries of new articles.
I also want to have references to other websites either news pages or social media.

The internet provides to of pictures from nature, astronomy, animals, and so on.
I like to have a collection of high quality wallpapers.

I'm interested in Java, Spring and AI.
So, I was looking for an interesting use case.
This project helps me to keep up with existing technology.

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract) of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents (with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

The Webscraper fetches web pages from the Internet and perform following actions:

1. Provides summaries using a local LLM and searches for references at other web sites.
2. Downloads pictures, then presents two to the user to choose the preferred one.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders.
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

|===
|Priority | Quality goal | Scenario
| 1
| Adaptability - The software should run on different devices (desktop, laptop etc) and with different setups (databases, w or w/o LLM etc).
| Webscraper should run on my AMD Ryzen 7, 64 GB RAM, 2 TB SSD w/ Win 11 and on my Raspberry PI 3, 1 GB RAM with Raspbian 11.
| 2
| Recoverability - The state of the software must be persisted so that it can be started, stopped or restarted everytime.
| Webscraper must be started when the computer has been turned on and must be stopped when the computer has been turned off.
| 3
| Modifiability - The software must be easily modifiable in order to implement new use cases.
| The implementation of a new use case must be done in 10 hours.
| 4
| Testability - The software must be tested according to the test pyramid.
| All classes and business logic must be unit tested.
Integrations with websites, databases, and files must be integration tested.
Interactions should be tests with end-to-end tests.
| 5
| Modularity - The domains of the structured in a modular way so that they have clear interfaces the directed dependencies.
| Webscraper must be modularized and ideally communicates via events.

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
